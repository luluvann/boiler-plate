# Simple Website Boiler Plate
Boiler plate to start coding a brand new responsive website faster

## Description of the repo
I started to build many websites lately and everytime, I was going through copy-paste process (from my past website into the new website). I thought it would be easier and time saving to just create a boiler plate code that I can simply clone. And that's how this repo was born!
This repo includes all the necessary files and links to the famous libraries (JQuery, Bootstrap 4, FontAwesome) to start coding a website faster.
